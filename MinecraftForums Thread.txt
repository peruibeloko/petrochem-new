You already know the oil from Buildcraft right? And you might think "Man, what am i going to do with all this oil except refining it into Fuel?!" Well good ol' chap, i have the WIP solution :)

REFINERYCRAFT: For all your oil-ish needs.
_____________________________________________________________________________________

THE IDEA:



the idea of Refinerycraft is to make oil refinery more Challenging. But how? Well, in real life the petroleum is refined in HUGE fractionating towers (just like the small ones in Chemistry!) that refine it in 6 basic components:

Solid residues

Lubricating oil


Diesel oil

Kerosene

Gasoline

and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas)

In this mod, you can do the same thing.



THE CURRENT PROGRESS:
